These are my user-specific configuration files that I use to personalize my Windows experience.

### Starship

### Windows-Terminal-Settings

### Launch in QuakeMode
* Open Windows Terminal and json settings file,
* Press Ctrl+Shift+P to open the Settings menu.
* In the search bar, type quake to find the Quake mode settings.
* Set keys u want to use to open the terminal
```
        {
            "command": 
            {
                "action": "quakeMode",
                "desktop": "toCurrent",
                "monitor": "any",
                "name": "quakeMode",
                "toggleVisibility": true
            },
            "keys": "ctrl+win+Ã¤"
        },
```
### Startup in QuakeMode
* Type %APPDATA%\Microsoft\Windows\Start Menu\Programs\Startup in the search bar and press Enter.
* Right-click in the folder and choose "New > Shortcut".
* In the "Type the location of the item" field, enter the following command:
* ``` wt ; new-tab -p "Windows PowerShell" -d "%USERPROFILE%" ```
* This will open Windows Terminal in Quake mode, with a new tab open to the Windows PowerShell shell and the working directory set to your user profile directory.
* Click "Next" and give the shortcut a name, such as "Windows Terminal (Quake mode)".
* Click "Finish" to create the shortcut.
* Now, every time boot in to windows, the Windows Terminal will launch automatically in Quake mode with the specified settings.
